# Hello, my dear visitor! 👋  

I'm a **Bachelor's student in Artificial Intelligence**, passionate about **programming** and continuously improving my understanding of **mathematics**. Currently, I'm pursuing my **undergraduate degree**, where I'm strengthening my foundation in **linear algebra**, **analytic geometry**, and **calculus**, while also exploring the exciting world of **neural networks** and **machine learning**.  

As a **student**, I enjoy tackling challenges and using **programming as a learning tool**. I've been building projects that help me apply mathematical and computational concepts in real-world scenarios. My main interests lie in **FinTech**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Data Science**, and I'm always looking for opportunities to combine these fields in creative ways.  

I'm dedicated to continuous learning and love being part of the **tech community**—sharing knowledge, working on projects, and expanding my portfolio as I explore **AI** and **Data Science**.  

Currently, I'm focusing on **Python** and **C language**, and I'm always open to collaborating on exciting projects or discussing innovative ideas. Let's build something amazing together! 🚀

## 📌 My Top Projects  
Here are three projects that reflect my journey of learning and growth:  

1. **K-Means Algorithm for Fish Distance Calculation** 🐟  
   A clustering algorithm that calculates the distances between fish based on their features. This project helped me explore how machine learning can be applied to biological data.  

2. **Calculus 1 Algorithm: Limits and Derivatives** 📐  
   A computational tool that assists in solving problems related to limits and derivatives—created as a way to reinforce my own understanding of calculus while programming.  

3. **3D Earth Model Generator (.obj)** 🌍  
   A Python project that generates a 3D model of Earth as an `.obj` file, where I experimented with geometric modeling and 3D visualization.
