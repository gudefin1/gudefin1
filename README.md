<h1> Hello!</h1>

I'm a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence enthusiast with a strong foundation in programming and mathematics. My academic journey focuses on mastering fundamental concepts like linear algebra, analytic geometry, and calculus, while simultaneously exploring the fascinating world of neural networks and machine learning.

As a self-taught learner, I thrive on intellectual challenges and have developed some projects applying mathematical concepts to real-world problems.

I'm deeply committed to the tech community, regularly sharing my knowledge and continuously building my portfolio with projects that showcase my growing curiosity around AI and Data Science.

Currently focusing on Python and C lang, I'm always eager to collaborate on innovative projects and connect with fellow tech enthusiasts.
